# Atlassian Jira for Docker

__docker-atlassian-jira__ provides [Atlassian Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) in a [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
container to support issue and project tracking for software teams.

>BETA: docker-atlassian-jira is currently in pre-release. That doesn't mean it's not ready for production, it just
means it hasn't been tested by a large audience yet. The more the merrier and the faster we get to v1.0. Install it,
open issues if you find bugs.

## Overview

## Installation

This application is ready to launch on a Docker host:

```sh
prompt> docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 markeissler/atlassian-jira:latest
```

## Usage

<a name="data-persistence"></a>

### Data Persistence

As configured, data on the following volumes will be created to persist data between container starts:

| Volume | Purpose                                                    |
|:-------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| /var/atlassian/jira                     | application configuration |
| /opt/atlassian/jira/logs                | runtime logs              |

### Data Persistence over NFS

It may be desirable to configure data persistence over NFS, in which case NFS volumes are mounted at the locations
described in the [Data Persistence](#data-persistence) section above. NFS support requires that the underlying Docker
host supports NFS; if deploying to a [Docker swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) a potential __boot2docker.iso__
candidate that supports NFS is the [boot2docker-nfs.iso](https://github.com/markeissler/boot2docker-nfs).

### SSL Support

You can enable SSL by simply copying a PKCS12 format certificate (`certificate.p12`) into the `JIRA_HOME` directory
(`/var/atlassian/jira`) and then restarting the container. The PKCS12 file format has been selected to make it easier to
generate certificates using `openssl`.

An example `openssl` command that will create a PKCS12 file from a private key (`server_key.pem`) and public certficate
(`server_cert.pem`) follows:

```sh
prompt> openssl pkcs12 -export -in server_cert.pem \
    -inkey server_key.pem -out certificate.p12 \
    -passout pass:changeit -name "jira"
```

On container startup, the PCKS12 format certificate.p12 file will be converted and stored in the system JKS keystore.
