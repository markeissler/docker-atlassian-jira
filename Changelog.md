Docker Swarm support! This version adds support for deployment to a cluster with a failover configuration. That is, only
one instance can be active at a time but the failover instance should startup without encountering errors stemming from
a corrupted _felix_ plugin cache.

Lucene indexes have been moved out of the Docker host's persistence directory so that configurations that enable data
persistence with NFS can be better supported (Lucene doesn't get along with NFS).
